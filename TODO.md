Splitting out the clients

- trim down the parent build file

- ensure project build and publish
- ensure site builds and publishes
- ensure travis works
- ensure coveralls works

- update documentation
- bump up the version and document the compatability issues
- are we semantic versioned?

- refactor testing to reduce duplication
    - HttpClientTestKit
(increase test coverage)
