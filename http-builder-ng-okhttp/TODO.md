# Ok-Http Implementation

- reduce client code duplication

- update the main build file (mainly the site stuff) to add new sub-project
    - can any more of that be simplified or brought into parent?

- update guide and other docs to add info about new client impl

- update the version: 0.11.1 or should it be 0.12.0?

- see if I can fill in some of the test coverage gaps
